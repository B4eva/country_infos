The app is both responsive and adaptive. It will move to the center of the screen when some certain contrains are met. 

I make use of material design principles.

* go_router : A Declarative Routing Package for Flutter. This permit the app to easy transit from one screen to another.

* Riverpod_flutter: For state management.

* http: This is use for http calls and networking.

* grouped_list: This is used to seperate the country list data in descending order by name.
